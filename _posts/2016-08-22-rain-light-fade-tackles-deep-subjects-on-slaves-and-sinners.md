  A Seattle-area rock band's new CD takes aim at a very heady topic: the
  trafficking of children for sexual exploitation. The songs on Rain Light Fade
  's 'Slaves and Sinners' also tackle what singer and keyboardist Dane Vance
  Creek calls "the objectification of women and the culture that breeds it., but
  so often refuses to acknowledge that it's even happening."
