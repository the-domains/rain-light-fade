Dane | Vocals

Dane is a lover of drama. Aside from music and acting, he also loves being a husband and a dad, as well as rain forests, Ireland, water, and naturalistic holograms. His current favorite album is Nine Inch Nails', "Hesitation Marks."

Steve | Drums

Steve has been playing music since the age of 5, starting with piano lessons. Along his journey to RLF, he has played in marching bands, jazz bands, and blues bands. At his core, Steve is a rock drummer and has played in several Seattle area bands including Common Heroes, along with current RLF guitarist Ira Merrill. When not spending time with his family, working, or drumming in RLF, spends it thinking about drumming...

Mike | Bass 

Mike grew up in Colorado, spent a few years in Iowa and moved out to Seattle in 2008\. He has played bass in a handful of bands, though he not-so-secretly wishes he was a drummer. He is very humbled to be playing with such exceptional musicians that are Rain Light Fade. They are humbled that he is humbled.

Ira | Guitar and Vocals

Ira has been a singer/songwriter/guitarist in the Seattle area for a long time. Before joining Rain Light Fade, he played in the bands Super Deluxe, Common Heroes, Pris, Run For It Marty, and more. He records solo material under the name Hemlock Pop, has a side project with drummer Steve called Crashdown Butterfly, likes hoodies, coffee, computers, tattoos, and wishes it was still the 1970s.

Ian | Guitar, Vocals, and Synths 

Ian is the baby of the group. Being the youngest, he brings the "hip" and "cool" factor to the band. Raised on rap-core and the Moulin Rouge soundtrack, he is the secret sauce. A husband and father of three, Ian enjoys reading, recording and mixing, working in the productions and design world, video games, and his beard.
